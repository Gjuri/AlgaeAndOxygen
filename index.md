### What is the relationship between Algae community and Oxygen ?.

Algae is a term that means ‘seaweeds’ in Latin and it represents a diverse community of photosynthetic organisms that sustain the world food chain. These organisms are microscopic plants and plant-like microorganisms, such as green algae, red algae, diatoms, dinoflagellates, and other eukaryotic algae. Even though cyanobacteria correspond to phylum bacteria, and hence they are not included in the algae community, they are photosynthetic organism which presence affect the lake water quality.

This type of organism produces their own food source through photosynthesis, and hence  they need  light and dioxide carbon (CO2) as the basic building blocks for this process. As a result, they produce their food (sugar) and, as a waste product,  release oxygen (O2) to the water column, in the same way as the terrestrial plants release it into the atmosphere. The photosynthesis is a crucial process for fresh water since it allows the development of multiple organism and the maintenance of the lake water quality.

In absence of light the reaction occurs in the other direction, meaning that the photosynthetic organisms consume the sugar produced in the day using oxygen to release the energy that they need. As a result, algaes produce energy and, as a waste product, dioxide carbon (CO2) and water (H2O). 
	
In this way, during the day one can expect that the oxygen concentration in the water is elevated since the presence of photosynthetic organisms. The latter phenomenon is expressed in all water bodies including the lakes, to illustrate the relationship we can take a look at the chlorophyll-a and oxygen concentration data collected from L’Explore on lake geneva.

Why chlorophyll-a ? Because chlorophyll-a is a molecule contained in the chloroplasts of all photosynthetic organisms which act as a photoreceptor of the light that provides the energy in the generation of sugar. Furthermore, the chlorophyll-a being easily detectable by its green coloration and a direct proxy of phytoplankton biomass in relation to nutrient concentration, it is commonly used as a representative of the algae and cyanobacteria concentration.

Knowing the equivalence between chlorophyll-a and the algae concentration, we can now analyse the relationship between Chl-a and the dissolved oxygen as a function of the depth in the plot below.

As we can see in the previous image, the algae community increases with depth until a certain depth (12 metres, in Geneva Lake), and then it starts to decrease as a function of the depth. If we now look at the oxygen concentration as a function of time it is possible to observe that it follows the same behaviour as chlorophyll-a. As discussed before, since the algae concentration increases, more oxygen is released by the photosistsis done by these organisms. 

	Why does the algae concentration start at a lower concentration ? At the first metre of the lake water column, the light intensity is too high to be tolerated by the organism., causing the photoinhibition of the photosynthetic species. As a consequence only few species and individuals can be found at a shallower depth, while a wider range of organisms can live at a moderate depth, which is expressed as an increase in the chlorophyll-a. 

A similar principle is behind the decrease of the chlorophyll-a in deeper water, but in this case the absence of light generate the decrease in chlorophyll-a and the oxygen produced.
