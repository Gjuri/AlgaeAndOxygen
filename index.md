### What is the relationship between Algae community and Oxygen ?.

Algae is a term that means ‘seaweeds’ in Latin and it represents a diverse community of photosynthetic active organisms that sustain the world food chain. These organisms are microscopic plants and plant-like microorganisms, such as green algae, red algae, diatoms, dinoflagellates, and other eukaryotic algae. Even though cyanobacteria correspond to the phylum of bacteria, and hence they are not included in the algae community, they are also photosynthetic active organisms which affect the lake water quality if present.

Algae produce their own food source through photosynthesis, and hence, they need  light and dioxide carbon (CO2) as the basic building blocks for this process. As a result, they produce their food (sugar) and, as a waste product,  release oxygen (O2) to the water column, in the same way as terrestrial plants release it into the atmosphere. Photosynthesis is a crucial process for fresh water since it allows the development of multiple organisms and the maintenance of the lake water quality.

In absence of light, the reaction occurs in the other direction, meaning that the photosynthetic active organisms consume the sugar produced during the day using oxygen to release the energy that they need. As a result, algaes produce energy and, as a waste product, dioxide carbon (CO2) and water (H2O). In this way, during the day one can expect that the oxygen concentration in the water is elevated since the presence of photosynthetic active organisms. The latter phenomenon is expressed in all water bodies including lakes. To illustrate the relationship, we can take a look at the chlorophyll-a and oxygen concentration data collected from L’Explore on lake Geneva.

Why chlorophyll-a ? Because chlorophyll-a is a molecule contained in the chloroplasts of all photosynthetic active organisms which act as a photoreceptor of the light that provides the energy in the generation of sugar. Furthermore, the chlorophyll-a being easily detectable by its green coloration and a direct proxy of phytoplankton biomass in relation to nutrient concentration, it is commonly used as a representative of the algae and cyanobacteria concentration in water bodies.

Knowing the equivalence between chl-a and the algae concentration, we can now analyse the relationship between chl-a and the dissolved oxygen as a function of the depth in the plot below.

As we can see in the image below, the algae community increases with depth until a certain depth (12 metres, in Lake Geneva), and then it starts to decrease as a function of the depth. If we now look at the oxygen concentration as a function of time, it is possible to observe that it follows the same behaviour as the chlorophyll-a concentration. As discussed before, since the algae concentration increases, more oxygen is released by the photosynthesis done by these organisms.

Why does the algae concentration start at a lower concentration ? At the first metres of the lake water column, the light intensity is too high to be tolerated by the organisms, causing the photoinhibition of the photosynthetic active species. As a consequence, only few species and individuals can be found at a shallower depth, while a wider range of organisms can live at a moderate depth, which is expressed as an increase in the chlorophyll-a concentration. 

A similar principle is behind the decrease of the chlorophyll-a in deeper water, but in this case, the absence of light generates the decrease in chlorophyll-a and the produced oxygen. For sure, there are other factors influencing the chl-a and oxygen concentrations in lakes (e.g., water temperature, mixing, nutrient availability)
